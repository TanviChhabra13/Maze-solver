**Overview**

**This project implements and visualizes solutions to maze traversal problems using three popular algorithms:**

-Breadth-First Search (BFS)

-Dijkstra's Algorithm

-A* Search (A-Star)


**The maze is represented as a grid where:**

-0 indicates an open cell.

-1 indicates a wall or obstacle.

The start and end points are predefined, and the path is visualized dynamically.
